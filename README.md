# hyperKitGL

hyperKitGL provides WebGL, Html5 and Float32Array structures for trilateral3, but can be used separately for working with WebGL and Canvas.

## notes

- hyperKitGL collates aspects of my htmlHelper, kitGL, and dsHelper.

- Ideally you can get started by inheriting PlyMix.

- [hyperKitGL API code documentation](https://nanjizal.github.io/hyperKitGL/pages/)

- no dependancies.

- works well but may need more work for production quality.

- features experimental aspects, to help explore Webgl and Canvas.

- [release v0.0.1-alpha](https://github.com/nanjizal/hyperKitGL/releases)

## known issues

- Sheet has some mouse support but it's only currently been tested on mac retina and known to be out elsewhere.

- a projection matrix is not currently wired up in PlyMix against shaders.
